Using ssb to record metadata associated with multi-signature bitcoin transactions.  

Multi-sig wallets such as Electrum do not allow us to see cosigners in payment history, or to share payment descriptions and other notes.

This project will use secure-scuttlebutt to store this information, as well as to provide a mechanism for sending and viewing partially signed transactions.

Currently its a work in progress.
